              The three women featured on my first coding webpage are my
              inspiration for working moms who acknowledge the challenges and
              joys that come from motherhood. Mom Depot is shining light on
              these three women who are there to help other women through the
              many paths that motherhood brings into out lives. Hey Shayla
              shares her prenatal and postnatal advice as well as her learning
              experiences with things such as "Elimination Communication". Safe
              in the Seat advocate, she cares so much about carseat safety she
              rarely even says her own name over how to do our best keeping our
              children safe and staying aware. Myriam Sandler, is a mother where
              I do remember her name. She seems to be able to do it all as far
              as conquering all the stages of development. I love all of these
              women and created this page to offer links to their direct source.

              I learned how to use javascript with this app. I learned how to
              incorporate API into code. I was able to organize code in a simple
              and easy to use weather app. This app will give the current
              weather for any city you type. It will also generate a future
              weather forcast along with images to display the expected weather.
              It also provides the date and time for any city searched for.
